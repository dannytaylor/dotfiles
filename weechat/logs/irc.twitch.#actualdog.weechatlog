2017-02-08 13:49:14	celloe	are you heading to gdc this year
2017-02-08 13:50:08	regyptian	i'm thinking about doing an episodic release for my game so i don't have to get a real job & then try to finish it part time
2017-02-08 13:51:08	indianadixon	didn't they try that with Hitman?
2017-02-08 13:51:17	regyptian	nice. early access is a better fit for something like this for sure

2017-02-08 13:54:46	regyptian	ya... a real problem is some things get a ton of press when they come out on early access & people decide what it is. people don't realize that like 2 months of dev time can change everything
2017-02-08 13:55:06	indianadixon	I mean, wobble dogs already has more depth than no mans sky so I wouldn't be worried
2017-02-08 13:55:13	ghoulesbian	i think people will like this regardless of how it turns out unless it ends up being a black screen that sayts *** you

2017-02-08 13:59:23	mousefountain	it's kind of blurry for me
2017-02-08 13:59:54	celloe	did your dog codebase start out so script-component heavy? eg fear, hunger, surprise etc all being their own separated scripts
2017-02-08 13:59:56	regyptian	that could def be a cool part of the game. customizing their living space to do weird things
