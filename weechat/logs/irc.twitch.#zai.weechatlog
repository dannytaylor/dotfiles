2017-02-08 03:08:33	ki19afe	he is countered easily
2017-02-08 03:08:38	sirtoastbrot	Because he's the flavour of the patch and people in Dota will just do whatever the pro scene does.
2017-02-08 03:08:45	ki19afe	squishier than a support

2017-02-08 03:09:21	dankmemer2001	@ki19afe personal skill and the hero's viability competitively don't go hand it hand, for instance people think LD and Ember are broken because anyone can use them

2017-02-08 03:10:45	belekas34	ember is only annoying because of lvl 25 talent, perma chains

2017-02-08 03:14:36	awesomecow1988	@Dankmemer2001 He's going for an entertainment type of stream so he panders to all the memers and kids that get him views. If that's what he wants to do for a living, so be it.

2017-02-08 03:17:03	gaijinzaa	I don't know. I've never seen the appeal of Bulldog's stream. His jokes are the type that only kids under 12 would find funny and he overuses all his memes to the point where it's annoying.

2017-02-08 03:19:48	awesomecow1988	@Dankmemer2001 I haven't watched him in a while so I can't really say anything about that. His gameplay on brood was consistenly great, maybe he goes to much for meme builds idk. And not everyone cares about great gameplay so eh. If people watch him to have a laugh I can't really fault them for it, apart from having bad taste

He could easily be a Calvin Klein model if he wanted to, or be a track runner because he was so athletic in high school. It's hard to believe someone who was so blessed chose to play video games for a living and he's even kicking *** at that too.

2017-02-11 16:53:48	admiral_aardvark	@Nymudota, If you can't get to sleep before a reasonable time I highly recommend doing an exhausting work out. makes you so ready for bed by 11pm-midnight
2017-02-11 16:53:55	prklstna	@Genzey, having hotkeys always at same positions would be beneficial on the long run but since some players have been playing with legacy for up to 10 years it is very realistic to change
2017-02-11 16:54:03	avimm	@Nymudota, the real strat is to stay up for a day and a half and then sleep for 10 hours
2017-02-11 16:54:07	nymudota	@admiral_aardvark I'll stay up until like 10 am - 12 pm and then pass out and sleep until 7 pm and still feel tired so pass back out and sleep until like 10 pm

2017-02-11 16:55:11	nymudota	@admiral_aardvark yes but I've been having really bad withdrawals so at the same time I feel really weak, and I've been getting random bouts of nausea. The internet tells me this takes anywhere from a week or two to pass before I start feeling like myself again.

Moreover, BSJ wears the most seemly clothing, dines at the most genteel restaurants and abides with the most alluring of gentlemen. You all have my pity.

He could easily be a Calvin Klein model if he wanted to, or be a track runner because he was so athletic in high school. It's hard to believe someone who was so blessed chose to play video games for a living and he's even kicking *** at that too.

2017-02-15 23:51:28	suicide_machines	@1209_, they added a new command so u can filter messages in chat which pretty much removes the bots.
2017-02-15 23:51:29	chimothy	its the only thing gw2 has going for it
2017-02-15 23:51:30	baduizm	@Nodarg, yeah i thought WvW sounded awesome, then it was just ppl zerging across the map

2017-02-15 23:51:38	canowhoop	@Nodarg xd
2017-02-15 23:51:39	carvolo	@Nodarg GW2 became a weeabo fightin magickz game, no obvious skillset and everything was dumbed down 4Head.
2017-02-15 23:51:41	chimothy	you need a large guild
2017-02-15 23:51:42	kiweekw	I don't remember much of this, but what was the point of vanquishing areas in hard mode?
2017-02-15 23:51:43	nodarg	@canowhoop, I remember trolling other guilds with touch ranger builds xD
2017-02-15 23:51:46	welovewaffles	Haven't done any Living Story yet in GW2
2017-02-15 23:51:49	chimothy	they werent all like that

2017-02-15 23:51:51	admiral_aardvark	@Nodarg, I was really sad they turned ultimates into the "press F once every two minutes to swing momentum" The 5-second recharge build-defining ultis of gw1 PvP was such a good approach in my opnion
2017-02-15 23:52:09	alezmond	what game is this

2017-02-15 23:53:04	admiral_aardvark	I do think GW2 excelled at having a world that was really cool to explore. It was the different mechanics that made it feel so off though
2017-02-15 23:53:08	canowhoop	lots of fun builds. anyone do 1v1 battle arena?
2017-02-15 23:53:10	stone_battler	i remember doing trap ranger underworld farming
2017-02-15 23:53:28	fonzo_	i still log in and do some UW farming with a rit
2017-02-15 23:53:42	admiral_aardvark	For people that want a casual MMO where its just fun to check out the world and get 100% completing on things though GW2 is a really neat thing
2017-02-15 23:53:42	nodarg	literally the only thing I prefer in gw2 over gw1 was the ability to jump and the platforming they incorporated
2017-02-15 23:53:43	carvolo	@Admiral_aardvark Some builds felt really underwhelming though, why play necro when you could play warrior spin 2 win with crit gear.

2017-02-16 00:17:40	admiral_aardvark	@xtoick, I guess rhythm would be the synonym for mechanics in starcraft but the need to always think 5 minutes ahead about 'what units he make and how do I counter it' adds a notably deep level of thought behind all the chaos
