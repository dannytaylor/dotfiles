2017-02-13 19:34:07	strimclocks	Is there anyone you don't think is OP, MopHead?
2017-02-13 19:36:38	strimclocks	Get rid of Symmetra?
2017-02-13 19:39:15	strimclocks	I think that if you don't get to freeze with left click then her ultimate needs to last longer.

2017-02-13 19:45:03	strimclocks	Zenyatta slow with normal left click?

2017-02-13 19:51:16	strimclocks	You see; I think that Mei isn't that OP. She is just within tolerable levels of difficulty.
2017-02-13 19:53:11	strimclocks	I do get what you mean. It might be why they made Symmetra have the slowing turrets.
2017-02-13 19:54:56	strimclocks	I think that most of the CQC people are very powerful.
