2017-02-09 16:07:46	supermousse99	How did you check for bugs in the Epilogue? Would be interesting to hear since you're pretty limited in terms of movement.
2017-02-09 16:07:49	cryze92	do you also try to figure out why it happens or is the report just about that it happens?
2017-02-09 16:07:56	olivepackage	upgrading to the ps4 pro for that
2017-02-09 16:08:05	jbzdarkid	bug usually includes steps to repro if possible
2017-02-09 16:08:08	robinoyo	I guess most of it is simple out of bounds movement checks @supermousse99

2017-02-09 17:07:39	moonfane	Listen, if Ellie was a dog she would have been more likable and it would be a good reason for her to run around not sneaking like an idiot because there's less reasons for enemies to concern themselves with a dog walking around than with Ellie.

2017-02-09 17:14:41	venbright	so, it's one setting, and its a real timer which you can't pause
2017-02-09 17:14:43	moonfane	Real Time Attack is a stupid name btw

2017-02-09 17:15:01	venbright	But some games use in-game timers if they have it, and it depends on the community for that game, really.

2017-02-09 17:17:30	murphylawson	How could you abuse/mess up the in-game timer?
2017-02-09 17:17:33	jbzdarkid	So you follow SDA timing
2017-02-09 17:17:37	venbright	In games like Dark Souls, people quitting to avoid it is totally a thing some do.
2017-02-09 17:17:39	jbzdarkid	(whoever is on mic)
2017-02-09 17:17:49	venbright	It ultimately depends on the community who run the game. They choose the rules.
2017-02-09 17:18:08	beardyduck	then you deny it because it's not single segment

2017-02-09 17:18:38	guchiandra	Ovendonkey, does working as a game tester need you to have some knowledge in programming?
2017-02-09 17:18:45	jbzdarkid	When SDA was a thing, SDA timing was a thing. It's basically 'first input' to 'last input'

2017-02-09 17:28:16	gunnz4hire	so I saw a 1 TB ps4 pack with 1 controller, 3 months of ps+ Horizon zero dawn + uncharted 4 for 344€ think thats a good deal then?
2017-02-09 17:28:30	bestgameplayer10	Yes
2017-02-09 17:28:33	blackcat14	mainly because the Heavenly Sword came out on chains in the range stance

2017-02-09 17:48:33	moonfane	Maybe they only want you, the established Mirror's Edge runner.
2017-02-09 17:48:39	bestgameplayer10	The only game I could probably run efficiently is Resident Evil 4
2017-02-09 17:48:51	moonfane	Let me axe you a question.
2017-02-09 17:49:01	moonfane	Why do RE runners only do NG+
2017-02-09 17:49:11	murphylawson	I've always kinda wished they'd include really long runs like GTA or Final Fantasy
2017-02-09 17:49:16	murphylawson	But maybe I'm just weird
2017-02-09 17:49:17	bestgameplayer10	It's faster and simpler Moonfane
2017-02-09 17:49:17	covert_madness	I've got a more boring speedrun - I ran Adr1ft which is literally floating through space slowly - as a speedrun
2017-02-09 17:49:18	jbzdarkid	They did FF recently
2017-02-09 17:49:25	moonfane	But it's so laaaameeeee
2017-02-09 17:49:37	alvaro_astorga	Is there any viva piñata speedrun?
2017-02-09 17:49:39	bestgameplayer10	I'd probably learn a New Game run tbh
2017-02-09 17:49:46	bestgameplayer10	But it'd have to be on Normal lol
2017-02-09 17:49:47	murphylawson	Omg Alvaroi_astorga I hope so
2017-02-09 17:49:53	moonfane	That's an excellent question, Alvaro
2017-02-09 17:50:00	moonfane	I want to watch a Viva Pinata speedrun now
2017-02-09 17:50:09	murphylawson	Alvaro_Astorga WR is 32:19
2017-02-09 17:50:13	bestgameplayer10	I could learn it on Professional but i wouldn't wanna risk anything.

2017-02-09 17:51:00	murphylawson	Yeah lmao. Google/Youtube "Viva Pinata Speedrun" it's like the only video
2017-02-09 17:51:08	moonfane	I'm leaving to go watch a viva pinata speedrun
2017-02-09 17:51:30	covert_madness	But each uncharted has to be bigger
2017-02-09 17:51:55	covert_madness	Uncharted 5 has a train towed behind an aircraft with drake surfing on the train
2017-02-09 17:52:07	guchiandra	Is there frame droppage? or is it only me?
2017-02-09 17:52:14	covert_madness	frames are dropping
