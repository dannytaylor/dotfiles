2017-02-15 16:33:00	ngoroth	can't really toggle with radiance
2017-02-15 16:33:01	vuikonw3t	Invoker uses a big purple EMP effect that drains all of your mana, as WK you should dodge it
2017-02-15 16:33:03	dota_magic_	@ToxicLG, landing tornado is maybe the easiest spell to land as invoker though
2017-02-15 16:33:07	345tom	Im surprised the spec didnt go diffu tbh
2017-02-15 16:33:10	leelandgrant	Radiance
