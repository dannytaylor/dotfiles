2017-02-09 14:40:40	@koopski	@Lombax818, i personally think its important to have strats and drafts lined up, but also leave room for flexibility in the draft. ie. first pick slardar and he can go into an offlaner or a support allowing for different strategies to be used based on draft development @Lombax818

2017-02-15 18:25:09	razaac333	@d5_scavenger I am going to assume you are not a troll and give you the clearest explanation I can. 8+2 = 10, but that equation is not what this skill is for. The spell goes on cooldown as soon as you throw it, so the first 2 seconds of the cooldown overlaps with the 2 second stun. this means that by the time your enemy comes out of the stun, the skill is already down to 6 seconds cooldown

2017-02-15 18:54:03	saevi	i really dont think buying two early-midgame items is a good idea on most carries
2017-02-15 18:54:08	cancerjesus	is he locking his camera to the hero at some points?
2017-02-15 18:54:23	myrarezz	purge is it worth it now to buy armlet now that scythe of vyse exists?
2017-02-15 18:54:24	bearlycivil	@Saevi, yeah that was my problem, feels like Armlet and Echo is either or, not both

This includes damage block, meaning that return damage can be blocked by damage block.
